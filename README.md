# Array-Type
Write a program to find the type of array using functions. An array is said to be “Even” if all the elements in the array are even. An array is said to be “Odd” if all the elements in the array are odd. An array is said to be “Mixed” if it contains some odd elements and some even elements. The return value of the function should be 1 if the array is Even. The return value of the function should be 2 if the array is Odd. The return value of the function should be 3 if the array is Mixed.
